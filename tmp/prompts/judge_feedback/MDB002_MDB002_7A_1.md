# Judge Feedback for MDB002 - MDB002_7A (Attempt 1)

One flaky test (TestMDB002_7A_T9) fails intermittently due to race condition in namespace auto-creation under load. Fix required: ensure proper namespace initialization synchronization before querying. All other 73 tests pass, code quality is good, architecture is sound.

## Instructions:
- Review the feedback carefully
- Make the necessary improvements
- Ensure all concerns are addressed
- Test your changes thoroughly

Please proceed with the improvements.
