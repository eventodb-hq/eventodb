# Judge Feedback for MDB002 - MDB002_7A (Attempt 1)

One test is failing consistently (TestMDB002_7A_T9_SubscriptionWorkflow) due to improper namespace handling in the test itself. The test creates a namespace 'test-ns' but then tries to write messages without properly setting the namespace context, resulting in writes going to the wrong database and getting 'no such table: messages' error. Additionally, one test is intentionally skipped due to a known SQLite race condition with concurrent namespace creation. Despite these issues, all core functionality is implemented, 71 out of 74 tests pass, performance is excellent (0.094ms p95, well below 50ms target), and the code is well structured. FIX REQUIRED: Update TestMDB002_7A_T9_SubscriptionWorkflow to properly use the created namespace when writing/reading messages, possibly by creating a token for 'test-ns' and using it in the write/read operations. Also investigate and fix the SQLite metadata table race condition causing TestMDB002_7A_T12_ConcurrentWrites to be skipped.
