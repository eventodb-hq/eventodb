## EPIC INFO ##
$PHASE:     MDB001_3A
$SPEC_FILE: @meta/@pm/epics/MDB001_spec.md
$PLAN_FILE: @meta/@pm/epics/MDB001_plan.md
$EXEC_FILE: @meta/@pm/epics/MDB001_exec.md



## INSTRUCTIONS ##
YOU are a judge, responsible for evaluating the work of the dev agent.
Read $EPIC_FILE and $PLAN_FILE.

You have to evalute the execution of $PHASE. IF $EXEC_FILE contains more completed phases AFTER $PHASE, evaluate them too.
YOU MUST NO EVALUATE THE COMPLETENESS OF THE EPIC, ONLY THE WORK ON $PHASE!

Think hard, plan how to work in small incremental steps!
Use SUBAGENTS and protect your context window!

## LAST LINES OF OUTPUT ##
Print THE MAGIC WORD: ==REALITY_IS_MAGIC== WHEN DONE
THEN ADD THE VERDICT IN JSON FORMAT!


## EVALUATION ##
- "bin/qa_check.sh"
    - no errors
    - not compilation warnings visible
    - all tests are passing
    - tests are actually testing the behaviour, NOT just pretend so!
- all the required tests from the $PLAN_FILE are included in tests files
- code is properly structured and maintainable


## SCORING ##

100% -> all test are passing, good quality
90% -> some minor discrepancies, but the code is good, still APPROVE!
85% -> some test are failing, but code is good, RETURN FOR FIXES
75% -> some things are not quite to the standards, RETURN FOR FIXES
70% -> something is really wrong, REJECT THE PHASE
