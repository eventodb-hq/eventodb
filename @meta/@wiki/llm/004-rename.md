I want to rename my project from eventodb to eventodb. 

Please analyze all the files in the current folder and suggest a strategy how to properly rename all occurrentrences of eventodb to eventdb. 


This is relevant for SDKs documentation, the Golang implementation, and documentation and tests. 


I want a script that works reliably and allows to validate the changes work correctly by running tests. 
It's fine to have multiple different steps that target isolated edge cases. 
If something is not working, we can just do a hard GIT reset. 

Create me plan for all the relevant files.
