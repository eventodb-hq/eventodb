Now Something special. 
I want to have a driver for timescaledb. 

And I want you to help me design the migration for timescale db. 
Can you help me decide how to structure the table in such a way that I can benefit from long term partitioning com data compression and I also want to be able to offload all data uh to to S a th3ree. later. And this means I want to have the option to efficiently um discard all old data.
